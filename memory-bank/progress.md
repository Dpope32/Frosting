### Cross-Platform
- Minor UI inconsistencies between platforms, specifically Web & iOS
- Some features have different capabilities on small native screens

### Data Management
- No backup/restore functionality yet
- Local-only storage limits cross-device usage
- No server ever. I do not want users data, just them to have the ability to sync.
