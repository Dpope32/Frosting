- 🔄 Test/Refine gesture handling in `BaseCardWithRecommendationsModal` (April 3, 2025)

## Planned Features

### Cross-Device Sync

- ⏳ Account management for sync

### Enhanced Security
- ⏳ Biometric authentication options
- ⏳ End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

### Additional Integrations
- ⏳ Additional financial data sources

## Known Issues
- 🔄 WiFi card wildly inconsistent (Attempted fix April 3, 2025 - Refactored `useNetworkSpeed` to measure latency)
- Bug in Drawer with profile picture not displaying
- ~~Fixed settings modal bug~~ (Resolved March 28, 2025 - `9b12208`)
- ~~Fixed Sentry error ("Invalid wallpaper path") in Settings Modal~~ (Resolved April 10, 2025)
- 🔄 Horizontal scroll gesture conflict in modals (Addressed by refactor April 3, 2025 - Needs testing)

### Performance
- 3ms to open the app (too slow)
- Some UI components could be optimized for better performance
  - Modals mainly
- Routing between screens tad slow, Expo router issue
- ~~Slow wallpaper switching during onboarding~~ (Resolved March 28, 2025 - `1459baa`)
- ~~Inconsistent wallpaper display on landing page~~ (Improved March 28, 2025 - `1459baa`)

### Cross-Platform
- Minor UI inconsistencies between platforms, specifically Web & iOS
- Some features have different capabilities on small native screens

### Data Management
- No backup/restore functionality yet
- Local-only storage limits cross-device usage
- No server ever. I do not want users data, just them to have the ability to sync.
